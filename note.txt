Vuex is a library for managing global STATE
STATE?
- state could simple be translated into DATA
  - data your application needs
  - data effects what user sees on the screen
- you can think of state as reactive data (data which may change, and where such changes then should trigger something on the SCREEN)

mutations?
- Mutations are clearly defined methods, 
which have the logic to update the state.
- And from inside our COMPONENTS, we just trigger those mutations instead of directly manipuating the state like `this.$store.state.counter`;
